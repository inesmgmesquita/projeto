                  <h1>About</h1>
                  <p>My name is Inês Mesquita and am a multidisciplinary graphic designer who graduated in Communication Design from the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Lisbon.</p>
                  <p>As an individual, I see myself as ambitious, dedicated and persistent, with a creative and curious outlook, and a strong desire to collaborate with new people on different projects to learn and grow. I am able to adapt to diverse projects and challenges using a multidisciplinary approach, with a critical perspective.</p>
                  <p>I’m currently working as a trainee designer at McCann Erickson, an advertising company based in Lisbon. My experience has been enriching, providing me with ample opportunities to collaborate with other professionals.</p>
                  <p>In addition, I am working with a colleague after receiving an invitation from professors at my alma mater to redesign the website of the Research Centre of the Faculty of Fine Arts. This project granted me a fresh outlook on academic work environments.</p>
