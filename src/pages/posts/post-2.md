subtitle: Navigate Your Digital Design Career
description: There is a vast number of different job roles in the Digital Design field, some of them with similar requirements and specifications. Consequently, designers (or people who want to work in this field) might find challenging to find the right job role according to their capabilities and personality. Digipath allows people to identify the digital design position they fit into by filling a 3-minute survey.
