title: E-commerce Website
subtitle: Building a Design System
description: During the Interface Design segment of my Digital Experience Design postgraduate program, I was tasked with crafting an e-commerce platform for a physical product of my choosing. This involved creating both the desktop version and establishing the components and style for the design system. The project aimed to develop an online storefront tailored to sell the selected physical product. A significant challenge was constructing a new Design System within defined constraints, which restricted color palettes, typography options, and component choices.
